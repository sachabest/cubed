# Cubed iOS

## Notes on Installing

Cubed was built on Unity 4.3 and has been recently upgraded to Unity 4.6. Many features included in 5 could improve the game but the porting overhead is intense. Please only run as is using Unity 4.x PRO.

The game relies heavily on Asset Store packages. Those used include:

* FingerGestures: Gesture handling and camera movement
* NGUI: Duh. Enough Said.
* FastGUI: Allows script based porting of UIs from Photoshop directly to NGUI.
* Prime31 GameCenter: Allows for GameCenter integration.
* Prime31 GC Turn Based: Allows for Turn-based multiplayer sessions on iOS.
* Prime31 Etcetera: All other iOS features you'd want to use.
